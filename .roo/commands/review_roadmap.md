# /review_roadmap - Validate Strategic Direction (Production)

**Purpose**: Reassess roadmap alignment after major deliveries or market changes, using MVP as the product contract.

**Usage**: /review_roadmap

## Steps
1. Read docs/MVP.md and ensure roadmap still reflects its priorities and reality checks.
2. Gather latest metrics (adoption, performance, reliability) from monitoring dashboards.
3. Compare outcomes against docs/ROADMAP.md success metrics and goal status in docs/BUSINESS_GOALS.md.
4. Identify gaps, risks, or opportunities; update risk register and release plans.
5. Adjust upcoming release themes or feature priorities and propagate to docs/SPRINT_BACKLOG.md and docs/sprints/ plans.
6. Document findings and decisions in docs/ROADMAP.md, docs/DECISIONS.md, and docs/STATUS.md → Technical Decisions.

## Output
- Updated roadmap entries with current status, risks, and references to MVP goals.
- Clear notes on how changes affect upcoming sprints or releases.
- Trigger /replan, /set_goals, or /start_sprint if scope changes significantly.
