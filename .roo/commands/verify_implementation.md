# /verify_implementation - Smart Task Verification

**Purpose**: Efficient verification that catches false positives without bureaucracy

**Usage**: /verify_implementation "[task_description]"

## Smart Verification Process

### 1. Automated Evidence Check
```bash
# Verify evidence exists and is recent
ls -la docs/evidence/[task_id]/
find docs/evidence/[task_id]/ -name "*.txt" -mtime -1
# Files must exist and be created within last 24 hours
```

### 2. Git Reality Check
```bash
# Cross-verify claimed implementation with actual changes
git log --oneline -5
git diff HEAD~2..HEAD --stat
git show --name-only HEAD

# Verify claimed file changes match git history
```

### 3. Build/Test Consistency Check
```bash
# Verify current state matches claimed test results
npm run build
npm test

# Compare with evidence files - results should be consistent
```

### 4. USER_REC Compliance Check
```markdown
For task: "[task_description]"
Find related USER_REC in docs/MVP.md

Requirements mapping:
- [ ] PRIMARY functionality implemented
- [ ] Core user workflow enabled  
- [ ] Error states handled reasonably
- [ ] Integration with existing features maintained
```

### 5. Spot-Check Manual Testing (10% of tasks)
```bash
# Random verification trigger
task_hash=$(echo "[task_description]" | md5sum | cut -c1-2)
if [ "$task_hash" = "00" ]; then
    echo "DEEP VERIFICATION REQUIRED"
    # Perform comprehensive manual testing
    # Require video evidence
    # Cross-examine all claims
fi
```

### 6. Red Flag Analysis
**Automatic escalation triggers:**
```markdown
‚ùå Evidence timestamp older than git commits
‚ùå Generic/template content in evidence files
‚ùå Perfect test results for complex features
‚ùå Missing git commits for claimed implementation
‚ùå Evidence file sizes suspicious (too small/large)
```

## Verification Decision

### VERIFIED (All criteria met)
- [ ] Evidence files exist and are authentic
- [ ] Git changes align with claimed implementation
- [ ] Build/tests pass consistently
- [ ] USER_REC requirements addressed
- [ ] No red flags detected

### NEEDS_WORK (Specific issues found)
```markdown
Issues identified:
1. [ISSUE]: [specific problem]
   - Evidence: [screenshot/log reference]
   - Fix needed: [specific action required]

2. [ISSUE]: [specific problem]
   - Evidence: [screenshot/log reference] 
   - Fix needed: [specific action required]
```

### CANNOT_VERIFY (Blockers present)
- Missing evidence files
- Inconsistent git history
- Build/test failures
- Major red flags detected

## Smart Enforcement

### Standard Verification (90% of tasks)
- Automated checks only
- Evidence file validation
- Git consistency check
- Build/test verification

### Enhanced Verification (10% of tasks - random)
- All standard checks PLUS:
- Manual browser testing required
- Video evidence mandatory
- Cross-agent review
- Detailed requirement analysis

## Output Format

### Verification Status: [VERIFIED/NEEDS_WORK/CANNOT_VERIFY]

### Automated Checks
- **Evidence**: ‚úÖ/‚ùå [files present and recent]
- **Git Changes**: ‚úÖ/‚ùå [commits align with claims]
- **Build/Tests**: ‚úÖ/‚ùå [consistent with evidence]
- **Requirements**: ‚úÖ/‚ùå [USER_REC addressed]

### Red Flag Analysis
- **Suspicious Patterns**: None/[list flags detected]
- **Authenticity Score**: High/Medium/Low
- **Verification Level**: Standard/Enhanced

### Next Actions
- **If VERIFIED**: Task ready for completion
- **If NEEDS_WORK**: Address listed issues
- **If CANNOT_VERIFY**: Resolve blockers and re-verify
- Missing dependencies
- Unclear requirements
- Environment issues
- Need additional information

### 7. COMMON FALSE POSITIVE TRAPS

**‚ùå Don't Accept These as "Working":**
- Component renders but buttons don't work
- Form submits but data doesn't save
- Page loads but features are broken
- Tests pass but manual testing fails
- API returns data but UI doesn't update
- Error states not handled
- Only works in ideal conditions

**‚úÖ Only Accept as "Working":**
- Real user can complete intended workflow
- All data operations work correctly
- Error cases are handled gracefully
- Feature integrates with existing app
- Works across different scenarios

## Output Format

### Verification Status: [VERIFIED/NEEDS_WORK/CANNOT_VERIFY]

### Manual Testing Evidence
**Browser Testing:**
- URL tested: [specific URL]
- User workflow completed: [detailed steps]
- Screenshots: [attach evidence]
- Issues found: [specific problems or "none"]

**Integration Testing:**
- Data persistence: [verified/failed]
- API integration: [working/broken] 
- Error handling: [adequate/inadequate]

### Red Team Results
**Break Testing:**
- [List what was tested to try to break it]
- [Document any breaking scenarios found]

### Final Recommendation
- **If VERIFIED**: Task can be marked DONE
- **If NEEDS_WORK**: Specific fixes required before DONE
- **If CANNOT_VERIFY**: Blockers that prevent verification

### Evidence Files
- Screenshots saved to: `docs/evidence/[task]/`
- Test logs saved to: `docs/evidence/[task]/`

## Verification Rules

1. **No manual testing = No VERIFIED status**
2. **Any broken workflow = NEEDS_WORK status**
3. **AI agent must provide evidence screenshots**
4. **Red team testing is mandatory for UI features**
5. **Integration testing required for all features**
  - Check route definition in FastAPI/Express
  - Verify request/response schemas
  - Check authentication/authorization
  - Verify error responses defined

### 4. **üîç Cross-Layer Integration Verification** ‚≠ê NEW

This step identifies gaps and inconsistencies between backend and frontend implementations.

#### 4.1 Backend ‚Üí Frontend Gap Analysis

**Purpose**: Find backend features NOT consumed by frontend

**Check for Orphaned Backend Features**:

```python
# Backend API Inventory
backend_endpoints = []
# From: src/routes/*.py or src/api/*.py
# Extract: all @app.route(), @router.get/post/put/delete()

backend_models = []
# From: src/models/*.py or src/schemas/*.py
# Extract: all Pydantic models, SQLAlchemy models

backend_services = []
# From: src/services/*.py
# Extract: all business logic functions
```

**Frontend API Usage Inventory**:

```typescript
// Frontend API Calls
frontend_api_calls = []
// From: frontend/src/**/*.{ts,tsx}
// Extract: all fetch(), axios.get/post/put/delete()
// Extract: all API endpoint strings

frontend_types = []
// From: frontend/src/types/*.ts
// Extract: all interface/type definitions

frontend_stores = []
// From: frontend/src/stores/*.ts
// Extract: all state management, data fetching
```

**Gap Detection**:

```
For each backend_endpoint:
  If endpoint NOT in frontend_api_calls:
    ‚Üí Mark as "Backend feature not integrated in frontend"
    
For each backend_model:
  If model has no corresponding frontend_type:
    ‚Üí Mark as "Backend data structure not typed in frontend"
    
For each backend_service:
  If service has no API endpoint OR endpoint not called by frontend:
    ‚Üí Mark as "Backend business logic not exposed/used"
```

#### 4.2 Frontend ‚Üí Backend Gap Analysis

**Purpose**: Find frontend features NOT supported by backend

**Check for Missing Backend Support**:

```
For each frontend_api_call:
  If endpoint NOT in backend_endpoints:
    ‚Üí Mark as "Frontend calling non-existent backend endpoint"
    
For each frontend_type:
  If type has no corresponding backend_model:
    ‚Üí Mark as "Frontend expects data structure not provided by backend"
    
For each frontend_store/state:
  If data source has no backend endpoint:
    ‚Üí Mark as "Frontend state management with no backend support"
```

#### 4.3 Contract Mismatch Analysis

**Purpose**: Find inconsistencies in shared contracts

**Check Request/Response Schemas**:

```
For each matching endpoint (exists in both layers):
  
  Backend Schema:
    - Extract: request body parameters
    - Extract: response body structure
    - Extract: query parameters
    - Extract: path parameters
    
  Frontend Usage:
    - Extract: data sent in request
    - Extract: expected response structure (TypeScript types)
    - Extract: query params used
    - Extract: path params used
    
  Compare:
    - Request fields: backend expects vs frontend sends
    - Response fields: backend returns vs frontend expects
    - Data types: backend types vs frontend types
    - Required vs optional fields
    - Field naming (camelCase vs snake_case)
    
  If mismatch found:
    ‚Üí Mark as "Schema mismatch between layers"
```

#### 4.4 Authentication/Authorization Gaps

**Check Security Implementation**:

```
For each protected backend_endpoint:
  - Check: authentication required (JWT, session, etc.)
  - Check: authorization/permissions required
  
For each frontend_api_call to protected endpoint:
  - Check: auth token included in request
  - Check: auth state management exists
  - Check: unauthorized handling (401/403)
  
If mismatch:
  ‚Üí Mark as "Auth/authz implementation gap"
```

#### 4.5 Error Handling Consistency

**Check Error Propagation**:

```
For each backend_endpoint:
  - Extract: all error responses (400, 404, 500, etc.)
  - Extract: error response format (code, message, details)
  
For each frontend_api_call:
  - Check: error handling exists (try/catch, .catch())
  - Check: error types handled match backend errors
  - Check: user feedback for errors (toasts, messages)
  
If mismatch:
  ‚Üí Mark as "Error handling gap"
```
