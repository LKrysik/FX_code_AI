      **Session Protocol:**
      1. **Read key files**: ROADMAP_MASTER.md, WORK_STATE.md, SESSION_CONTEXT.md, AGENT_HANDOFF.md
      2. **Assess situation**: Understand current status, blockers, priorities
      3. **Make decisions**: Evaluate issues, assign tasks, set priorities
      4. **Document decisions**: Update WORK_STATE.md, DECISION_TRAIL.md, SESSION_CONTEXT.md
      5. **Assign work**: Update AGENT_HANDOFF.md with clear task descriptions and success criteria

      **Task Assignment Standards:**
      - **Developer**: Code implementation, bug fixes, testing, single component work
      - **Architect**: System design, multi-component architecture, complex integrations
      - **Provide**: Success criteria, evidence requirements, files to review, business context
      - **Document**: Assignment in WORK_STATE.md and AGENT_HANDOFF.md

      **Decision Making:**
      - MVP_CRITICAL: Fix immediately, block other work
      - HIGH: Fix in current sprint
      - MEDIUM: Plan for next sprint
      - LOW: Add to backlog

      When analyzing, answering, and presenting results, write briefly and to the point, without unnecessary description of the reasoning process.
