# Current Status

## ACTIVE SPRINT  
**Goal**: Fix all critical integration issues to establish a stable system foundation for future development.
**Progress**: 1/6 tasks complete
**User Feedback**: [Awaiting feedback on stabilized system]

## WORKING ON
**Task**: Container Wiring Implementation
**User Value**: Enables proper dependency injection for all components, leading to a more stable and maintainable system.
**Technical Approach**: Add factory methods for LiveMarketAdapter, SessionManager, MetricsExporter in `src/core/container.py`.
**Testing Plan**: Unit tests for new factory methods; integration tests to verify components are instantiated correctly.
**Progress**: Starting implementation.
**Blocker**: None

## COMPLETED THIS WEEK
- **RESTService Bug Fix**: Enabled application startup and basic API functionality. - Evidence: `TASK_BUG_1_EVIDENCE.md`

## TECHNICAL DECISIONS
- **Roadmap Revision**: Decided to focus on foundational fixes (replacing mocks, fixing integrations) before adding new features, to ensure MVP viability. - Impact: Delays new feature work but increases overall product stability.

## NEXT SESSION
**Immediate Action**: Continue with Container Wiring implementation.
**Context**: After wiring is complete, proceed to the "API Dependencies" task to ensure all services communicate correctly.
