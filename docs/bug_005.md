55,paradox,verification,Barber Paradox,What ALTERNATIVE approach would you reject but if someone else proposed it you would consider better? Forces consideration of dismissed options,alternatives → rejection reasons → reconsideration
56,paradox,verification,Sorites Paradox,Remove elements one by one. Which single removal DESTROYS the solution? That element should have the MOST attention. Does it?,elements → removal test → priority check
57,paradox,verification,Newcomb's Paradox,What solution would SURPRISE you as solving this problem? If your current approach is not surprising it may be too obvious and miss creative solutions,expected approach → surprising alternatives → creativity check
58,paradox,verification,Braess Paradox,Which element SEEMS helpful but might actually HURT? Sometimes removing constraints or features improves the result,helpful elements → harm analysis → optimization
59,paradox,verification,Simpson's Paradox,The solution looks good in each part separately. What HIDDEN VARIABLE could make the whole worse than the parts?,parts analysis → hidden variables → integration check
60,paradox,verification,Surprise Exam Paradox,Where is the solution TOO CONFIDENT? What could surprise it? Overconfidence reveals blind spots,confidence areas → surprise scenarios → humility
61,paradox,verification,Bootstrap Paradox,Where does A require B and B require C and C require A? Circular dependencies must be identified and broken,dependencies → cycles → resolution
62,paradox,verification,Theseus Paradox,Does the CORE of your solution address the CORE of the problem? Or does it solve a different adjacent problem?,core solution → core problem → alignment check
63,meta,verification,Observer Paradox,Is this analysis GENUINE or PERFORMANCE? When responses sound too smooth they may be optimizing for appearance not truth,analysis quality → authenticity check → revision
64,meta,verification,Goodhart's Law Check,Am I optimizing for passing this check rather than achieving the actual goal? Metric gaming is a constant risk,goal vs metric → alignment → refocus
65,meta,verification,Abilene Paradox,What if there IS NO better approach? Am I finding problems where none exist just to justify the process?,problem existence → necessity check → acceptance
66,meta,verification,Fredkin's Paradox,In rejected alternatives what valuable elements could be EXTRACTED and combined with current approach?,rejected ideas → value extraction → hybrid solutions
67,meta,verification,Tolerance Paradox,Is there something that should be CATEGORICALLY REJECTED not just evaluated? Some constraints are absolute,evaluation scope → absolute limits → hard no
68,meta,verification,Kernel Paradox,I (agent) cannot objectively evaluate my own work. What must USER independently verify?,self-evaluation limits → user verification → handoff items
69,meta,verification,Godel's Incompleteness,What CAN'T this analysis check? What are its FUNDAMENTAL limits? No system can verify itself completely,analysis scope → limits → acknowledged gaps
