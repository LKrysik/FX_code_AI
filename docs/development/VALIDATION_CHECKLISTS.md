# Validation Checklists - Pre-Commit Quality Gates

## 🎯 MANDATORY VALIDATION PROCESS

**Every code change MUST pass these checklists** before commit. No exceptions.

## ✅ ARCHITECTURE VALIDATION

### Plugin Architecture Compliance
```bash
□ New functionality implemented as plugin (not hardcoded service)?
□ Plugin implements required interface (IIndicator/IStrategy)?
□ Plugin registered in appropriate registry?
□ Plugin configuration externalized to YAML/JSON?
□ Plugin supports hot-reloading without restart?
□ Plugin isolated from other plugins (no direct dependencies)?
□ Plugin validated with unit tests covering interface contract?
```

### Experimentation Framework Integration
```bash
□ New strategy supports A/B testing framework?
□ Parameters defined with optimization ranges?
□ Performance metrics tracked per parameter combination?
□ Configuration allows dynamic parameter updates?
□ Backtesting results available before production deployment?
□ Statistical significance validation implemented?
□ Rollback mechanism available for failed experiments?
```

## ✅ PERFORMANCE VALIDATION

### Real-Time Requirements
```bash
□ Critical path latency <50ms measured with profiling?

□ Cache hit rate >95% achieved and monitored?
□ No EventBus in critical signal processing path?
□ Direct function calls used for sub-50ms requirements?
□ Circuit breakers implemented for performance degradation?
```

### Memory Leak Prevention
```bash

```

### Monitoring System Impact
```bash
□ Monitoring CPU overhead measured under 2.5% total system?
□ Monitoring memory usage verified under 30MB total?
□ Added latency per operation validated under 200μs?
□ Monitoring budget enforcer tested with deliberate violations?
□ Emergency mode reduces monitoring to <0.3% CPU under stress?
□ P0 business metrics (order latency, market data) never disabled?

□ Integration tests prove monitoring doesn't impact trading performance?
```

### Business-First Monitoring Validation
```bash

□ Latency impact measured with microsecond precision?
□ Integration testing validates monitoring overhead under realistic load?

```

## ✅ BUSINESS LOGIC VALIDATION

### Domain Consolidation
```bash
□ Single source of truth maintained for each business domain?
□ No duplicate calculation methods across services?
□ Canonical implementation chosen for shared logic?
□ All duplicate implementations removed?
□ New functionality doesn't duplicate existing logic?
□ Business rules centralized in appropriate domain service?
□ Cross-cutting concerns handled via EventBus or interfaces?
```

### Configuration Management
```bash
□ All business values externalized to configuration?
□ No hardcoded values in business logic (7.0, 3.5, 30, 60, etc.)?
□ Symbol-specific configuration supported?
□ Parameter validation implemented?
□ Configuration changes don't require code deployment?
□ Default values provided for all parameters?
□ Configuration documentation updated?
```

## ✅ CODE QUALITY VALIDATION

### Method and Class Size Limits
```bash
□ Method length ≤50 lines verified?
□ Cyclomatic complexity ≤10 checked with tools?
□ Class size ≤300 lines validated?
□ Nesting depth ≤4 levels enforced?
□ Public methods per class ≤10 counted?
□ Large methods broken down into focused smaller methods?
□ Helper classes extracted for complex functionality?
```

### Error Handling Standards
```bash
□ Standardized error hierarchy used?
□ Error handling decorator applied consistently?
□ No silent failures - all errors logged appropriately?
□ Input validation implemented for all external data?
□ Graceful degradation under error conditions?
□ Circuit breakers for cascade failure prevention?

```

## ✅ CONTAINER AND DEPENDENCY INJECTION

### Container Architecture
```bash

## 🔍 AUTOMATED VALIDATION TOOLS

### Pre-Commit Hooks
```bash
# Memory leak detection
grep -r "defaultdict" --include="*.py" src/ && echo "❌ defaultdict found in production code"

# Hardcoded values detection  
grep -r -E "(7\.0|3\.5|0\.5|30|60|85|70)" --include="*.py" src/ && echo "❌ Hardcoded business values found"

# Performance validation
python scripts/validate_performance.py --max-latency=50ms --max-memory=1MB

# Architecture validation
python scripts/validate_architecture.py --check-plugins --check-interfaces
```

### Continuous Validation
```python
class ValidationPipeline:
    """Automated validation pipeline"""
    
    def validate_memory_patterns(self) -> ValidationReport:
        """Check for memory leak patterns"""
        pass
    
    def validate_performance_requirements(self) -> ValidationReport:
        """Verify performance targets met"""
        pass
    
    def validate_architecture_compliance(self) -> ValidationReport:
        """Check architecture pattern adherence"""
        pass
    
    def validate_experimentation_readiness(self) -> ValidationReport:
        """Ensure A/B testing capability"""
        pass
```
