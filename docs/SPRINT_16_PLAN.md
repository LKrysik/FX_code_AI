# Sprint 16 Plan - USER_REC_16 Indicator System Architectural Consolidation

## Sprint Objective
**GOAL_09**: Eliminate critical architectural flaws in the indicator system by consolidating duplicate calculation engines, removing orphaned code, and implementing proper separation of concerns to prevent data corruption and maintenance issues.

## User Value
After this sprint, the indicator system will:
- ✅ Have consistent calculation results across live/historical/backtest modes
- ✅ Be 40% more maintainable with eliminated duplicate code  
- ✅ Have zero data corruption from concurrent CSV writes
- ✅ Support efficient development with proper dependency injection
- ✅ Have improved performance from eliminated unnecessary layers

## Success Criteria & Exit Conditions

### Technical Success Criteria
1. **Single Source of Truth**: One `IndicatorCalculator` class used by all engines with identical results
2. **Zero Duplication**: No duplicate calculation implementations across codebase
3. **Proper Factory Pattern**: Single factory with correct return types, no adapter layer
4. **Separated Persistence**: Only `IndicatorPersistenceService` writes CSV files with file locking
5. **Clean Architecture**: Removed orphaned `UnifiedIndicatorEngine` (1,087 lines)
6. **Proper DI**: API routes use application context, not mock dependencies

### Measurable Outcomes
- **Code Reduction**: Remove 1,087+ lines of orphaned code
- **Performance**: Maintain calculation speed within 5% of baseline
- **Test Coverage**: 100% coverage of architectural changes with `[backend-pytest]`
- **Reliability**: Zero race conditions in CSV file operations

## Critical Analysis

### Implementation Risks
- **High Risk**: Removing `UnifiedIndicatorEngine` may break unknown dependencies
- **Medium Risk**: Factory consolidation could disrupt existing API consumers
- **Medium Risk**: CSV persistence changes might affect data integrity
- **Low Risk**: Dependency injection changes are isolated to API layer

### Risk Mitigation
- Create dependency audit before removal
- Backup current system before changes
- Incremental testing after each consolidation step
- Rollback plan with backup branches

### Dependencies
- **Blocker**: Current Sprint 15 completion (indicator consolidation in progress)
- **Prerequisite**: Comprehensive dependency audit of components to be removed
- **Integration**: Must maintain compatibility with existing variant management

**Evidence**: `docs/evidence/user_rec_16/`

### Key Findings from Dependency Audit:
- **18 Import References**: Comprehensive mapping of all dependencies to components being removed
- **Critical Shared Types**: IndicatorValue, IndicatorConfig require extraction before removal
- **CSV Race Conditions**: Confirmed conflicts between UnifiedIndicatorEngine and IndicatorPersistenceService
- **Orphaned Code Confirmed**: UnifiedIndicatorEngine (1,087 lines) never instantiated in production

### Risk Mitigation Established:
- **Backup Created**: Branch `sprint16-backup-USER_REC_16` at commit `7f9ea38`
- **7-Phase Plan**: Safe removal strategy with type extraction first
- **Test Coverage**: 10/10 backend tests pass for Task 1 verification

### Ready for Task 2:
- Dependencies fully understood, safe to proceed with IndicatorCalculator consolidation
- Migration path clear, risks identified and mitigated
