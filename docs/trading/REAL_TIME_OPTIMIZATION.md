# Real-Time Trading - Performance-Critical Implementations

## 🎯 OVERVIEW

Guidelines for implementing performance-critical components in real-time trading monitoring, focusing on efficiency and low latency.

## 🛠️ KEY IMPLEMENTATIONS

- **Async Processing**: Use asyncio for WebSocket handling and concurrent tasks.
- **Data Structures**: Deques for sliding windows, dicts for fast lookups.
- **Caching**: lru_cache for repeated calculations.
- **Logging**: JSON-structured, minimal in hot paths.

## 📜 BEST PRACTICES

- Profile hot paths with cProfile.
- Minimize allocations in loops.
- Batch notifications to reduce overhead.
- Implement rate limiting for APIs.

## 🚀 EXAMPLE

```python
import asyncio

async def process_data(stream):
    async for data in stream:
        # Efficient processing
        pass
```

Optimize for sustained real-time performance.
